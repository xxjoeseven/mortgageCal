## Java Coding Exercise

This repository is created to keep a copy of the first Java program I wrote while going through CodeWithMosh course.
Originally, the calculator is written with a step by step procedural approach. Afterwards, the code is refactored and
various methods are written to improve readability, inefficiency and re-usablility.

Methods
1) ReadNumber - This is written to validate the value of an entry a user inputs.
2) MortgageCal - This is the calculation of the mortgage itself.
3) BalanceCal - This is written to calculate balance.
4) PrintBalanceCal - This is written loop the calculation and print a balance schedule.
